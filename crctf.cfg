//	- pausable
//	- noexit
//	- deathmatch
//	- safepractice on/off

//
// Commands in the [normal], [practice], [match] and [individual] sections
// are only executed when the server starts a new level in the corresponding
// mode.  Commands in the [init] section are executed *once* when the server
// starts and then never again.  Commands before the [normal] section are
// executed each time the server starts a new level.
//
// Refer to the user's manual for a detailed explanation of how to use each
// command.

//
// The command to set the main password is
//
//   skill <password>
//   setpass
//
// The password can be any combination of four to seven digits.
// *** THE FIRST DIGIT MUST BE NON-ZERO ***
// The password must be set at the start of each level.
//
// NOTE: Administrators who use the main (code 0) password are put in
//       "privileged" mode.  **DO NOT** give out this password!
//
// *** CHANGE THIS ***
//
skill 1234
setpass

//
// Up to 9 additional passwords can be defined using the commands
//
//   skill <password>
//   setpassX
//
// Where X is a digit 1-9.  These passwords must be the same format as the
// main password.  Make sure that no password is an extension of another.
// For example, if password 2 is 1234 and the main password is 1234567,
// noone will be able to use the main password.
//
// Administrators who use one of these passwords cannot kick other
// administrators and are not privileged, so it is recommend that you give out
// one of these passwords to anyone who needs admin on your server.  It is
// further recommended that you create a different password for every
// server administrator (up to a maximum of 9) so that if a password
// leaks you know who leaked it (by using the 'admins' command).
