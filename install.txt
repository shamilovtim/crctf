Getting Started
\-------------/

1. 	Create a subdirectory in your Quake directory called 'crctf' or whatever
   	else you feel like calling it.

2. 	Unzip the contents of crctf3.zip into this new subdirectory.  Make sure that
   	whatever program you use to unzip the files preserves the directory structure
   	contained in crctf3.zip.

3. 	Edit autoexec.cfg, crctf.cfg, and levels.cfg.  Each of these files is
	commented with editing instructions.  Make sure you
   	change the passwords!  *Don't* give out password 0!!!

4.	Start up your quake server with '-game crctf' in the command line replacing
   	'crctf' with whatever name you gave your subdirectory.

Examples:

  wqpro.exe -condebug -game crctf -dedicated +hostname jurassic
  sqpro -condebug -game crctf -dedicated 16 +hostname essentrix

	The recommended quake executable for running a crctf server is ProQuake
	(http://quakeone.com/proquake).  It is also recommended that you use
	-condebug in the command line.  This will create a console log called
	Qconsole.log in your crctf directory.  It is useful for seeing what has
	happened on your server, and it can also help the debugging process if you
	encounter problems running crctf.  This file can also be given a different
	name, or even named sequentially so that successive runs of the quake
	executable don't overwrite previous log files (see the ProQuake manual
	for details).

0.1 Recommended Settings

The following settings are recommended for MATCH play:

	-zone 512 -condebug -dedicated 12 -deathmatch 1 +pausable 0 +noexit 1
	+samelevel 2 +teamplay 1 +sv_aim 2 +timelimit 20 +fraglimit 100

	zone 512 and condebug were explained above.  dedicated 12 allows for a
	reasonable number of players.  The maximum allowed by Quake is 16; this is
	almost always too many.  Most good servers set the limit to 10 or 12.
	deathmatch 1 is pretty standard and self-explanatory.  pausable 0 prevents
	players from pausing the game, which can be badly abused.  noexit 1 prevents
	a rapid progression through levels when there's always one person who doesn't
	like such and such a level.  sv_aim 2 allows players to shoot where they aim -
	it removes the vertical correction that is annoying to all experienced quake
	players.  timelimit and fraglimit are of course more subjective.. I have found
	30, 50 to be quite reasonable.  Note the *absence* of teamplay 1; all serious
	quake servers use teamplay 0 to prevent really cheap tactics with grenades,
	rocket launchers and lightening gun discharges.

	If the server is to be run in match mode, then -dedicated 16 is recommended
	to allow for the maximum number of observers, and teamplay should be set to 2.
